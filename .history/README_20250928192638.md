## Project Requirements

### Content

The site includes a profile picture on the landing page, along with a biography that introduces me as a web developer and UX designer. I also added a Projects section with visuals (From Pinterest) and descriptions of my work, as well as links to external sites like my GitHub. Medium and LinkedIn. A functional Contact Form (using Formspree) allows visitors to reach out directly.

Aesthetically, I chose a deep gradient palette with blue and orange tones for a professional yet creative feel. I also wanted to experiment with UI gradients and animations, so I have tried to use them from websites like Codepen. However, I also wanted to make the website accessible and not have too many of them. I used large, bold typography for section headers, rounded corners for images and cards, and hover effects to create interactivity. These choices keep the site clean, modern, and easy to navigate.

- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
      ​

### Technical

The website has two pages: index.html and play.html. It is version-controlled with Git, and is deployed on GitHub Pages. I followed responsive design principles, using flexible layouts and media queries to make the site work on mobile, tablet (this still needs some more work), and desktop. Semantic HTML tags (such as are used throughout to keep the code organized and accessible.

- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [x] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.

### Bonus (optional)

I included hover state on navigation links and buttons to improve user experience.
A JavaScript-powered play button was added for extra interactivity so that users can listen to lofi music while going through the website
Header uses an interactive star-trail cursor (code sourced from Codepen)
The contact section uses a spotlight cursor (code sourced from Codepen)

- [x] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [x] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)
